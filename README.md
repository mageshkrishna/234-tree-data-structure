# 2-3-4 Tree Data Structure

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the 2-3-4 tree data structure in Java. The 2-3-4 tree is a balanced search tree that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal operations. 

## How to Run the Code

1. **Copy the Code**: Locate the `234.java` file in this repository. Copy the entire code from this file.

2. **Run the Code**:
   - **Online Compiler**: Paste the copied code into an online Java compiler like [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler) and run it to see the implementation in action.
   - **Local Java IDE**: Alternatively, you can paste the code into your local Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) and run the program.

## Understanding the 2-3-4 Tree

Before diving into the code, itâ€™s crucial to understand the fundamental operations of the 2-3-4 tree. Below are two key resources to help you grasp these concepts:

1. **Insertion**: To understand the insertion process in a 2-3-4 tree, review this [lecture slide on 2-3-4 tree insertion](https://ranger.uta.edu/~alex/courses/3318/lectures/08_search_234_tree.pdf).

2. **Deletion**: For a detailed explanation of the deletion process in a 2-3-4 tree, refer to this [page on 2-3-4 tree deletion](https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/Courses/CS280/Trees-2-3-4-delete.html).

### Tips

- **Insert and Delete**: Ensure you understand how to perform both insertion and deletion operations on a 2-3-4 tree by reviewing the provided resources before attempting to understand the code.
